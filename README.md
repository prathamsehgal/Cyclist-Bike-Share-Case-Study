# Introduction
This exploratory analysis case study is towards Capstone project requirement for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The case study involves a bikeshare company's data of its customer's trip details over a 12 month period (April 2020 - March 2021).
The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.


## Deliverables:
1. Insights on how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently
2. Provide effective visuals and relevant data to support insights
3. Use insights to give three recommendations to convert casual riders to member riders


## Key Results
1. Casual riders made 41% of total trips contributing to 66% of total trip duration between Apr'20 - Mar'21. Member riders make up 59% of total trips contributing to 34% of total trip duration between Apr'20 - Mar'21

2. Usage (based on trip duration) of bikes by casual riders is almost twice that of member riders.

3. Casual customers use bikeshare services more during weekends, while members use them consistently over the entire week.

4. Average trip duration of casual riders is more than twice that of member rider over any given day of the week cumulatively.

5. Casual riders ride longer during first half of the year compared to the second half, while members clock relatively similar average trip duration month over month.

6. Casual riders prefer docked bikes the most while classic bikes are popular among members.

## Analysis and Recommendations:

1. Provide attractive promotions for casual riders on weekdays so that casual members use the bikeshare services ore uniformly across the entire week.

2. Offer discounted membership fee for renewals after the first year. It might nudge casual riders to take up membership.

3. Offer discounted pricing during non-busy hours so that casual riders might choose to use bikes more often and level out demand over the day.
